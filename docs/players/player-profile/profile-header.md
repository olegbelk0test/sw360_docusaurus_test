## Player Statuses

The player can have 5 different statuses:

* *Active* &mdash; the account is active and the player can normally play on the site.
* *Frozen* &mdash; the account freezes if the player failed login or recover password attempts. <p>The player can reactivate the account if he clicks on the link received by email or it can be reactivated by the operator.</p>
* *Closed / Self-Closed* &mdash; the operator closed the player's account (if *self-closed* &mdash; the player closed his account himself or the operator closed the account by the player's request).<p>Only the operator can reactivate the account from this status.</p>
* *Self-Excluded* &mdash; the account is self-excluded when the player chooses to take a break from gaming. He can choose the reason and the exclusion time period.<p>The operator with certain permissions can reactivate the account in rare cases.</p>
* *Cool-Off* &mdash; similar to the *Self-Excluded* status, but in this case, the account will be reactivated automatically when the time expires and no one can reactivate it manually.

To change the status &mdash; open the needed player profile and click the [**Change**] button to open the [Change Status Pop-Up](#change-status-pop-up):
