Game Transactions Tab is the list of game round actions. Game Transaction is created on each game round request &mdash; one row is for the one game transaction (round). It may contain wallet operations.

The operator can view Game Transactions as a single section at the BO:

The operator can search game transactions by Round ID &mdash; type or paste the needed value to the search bar and press **Enter**.

Below, there is a Game Transaction Table that contains all the site game transactions sorted by descending *Finished Time* by default.
